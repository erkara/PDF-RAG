Bottom line is that these models are trained to map similar context to similar vectors(in term of some metric such as cosine similarity). Key point is that it is a good idea to pick a task-spesific embedding model. For example, embedding models such as *FinBERT and FinLang* are primariluty trained on financial documents. We can also use *Sentence-T5 or MiniLM-L6-v2* which are good for general-purpose embeddings. For example, at the bottom of this notebook, you can observe that *FinLang* does a way better job then *Sentence-T5* since we demonstrate the model in financial documents.\n",

Despite the fact that limited functionality for dynamics updates or RAM usage, it is a good starting point for a small project.
